# Element

## About

A puzzle game that uses live video from the computer's webcam. I built this project for one of my classes at USC. It makes good use of the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library which is a client-side javascript library for creating graphic and interactive experiences for web.

## Run The Project

1) Clone the repository<br>
2) Run `npm install` in the directory<br>
3) Run `npm start` in the directory<br>
4) Open web browser to `localhost:3000`<br>
